All of your configurations (apart from a few such as member count which you will simply have to do /toggle again!) will be saved so don't worry! \n\nI apologise for this move, but the main reason is due to verification issues with the current application, meaning I must switch to another Discord Developer application in order to enable verification again. This doesn't change anything about Elite Bot\n\nHowever, due to requirements Elite Bot Music (which is what current application has been rebranded to) is now the sole music bot. There will no longer be a music feature within the MAIN Elite Bot due to future bot verification issues, hence if you wish for music, keep Elite Bot Music in your server!`)
